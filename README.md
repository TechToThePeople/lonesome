#Find contacts without groups

Some contacts are greated, but not assigned to any group. It most likely means that nothing is ever going to happen to them, as most of the targetting is done via groups (eg. in CiviMail).

This extension provides a custom search and a civisualize dataviz to let you find your individual contacts that don't belong to a group. 

Because no man is an island.
